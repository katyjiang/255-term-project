In this project, we will experiment with different types of recommender systems algorithms. By evaluating and comparing the accuracy of different models, find out the best combination of these models to create a high-precision hybrid movie recommendation system. 

The overview of our project System is shown below.

Due to the limitation of file size, we cannot upload original files to github (They are way too big). You could download all the files from this link : 
https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset

#### Only movie.csv is the original one. The rating-1.csv.zip contains a corpped file, it contain 2 million data, feel free to use them for running and testing. The other files (such as : tag.csv, genome_scores.csv and so on) contain movie genre and tag information, cannot be split, please go to the kaggle link we share and download them to run the project.


## To run and test our project:
Use Jupyter Notebook open the 255_Hybrid_Movie_Recommender_System.ipynb. And run with code block order. You can change userId to test different recommendation in each model section.
